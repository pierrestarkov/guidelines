# UX wording guidelines


## Pryv

- OK: "Pryv", "...on Pryv", "...on your pryv", "to pryv {something}", ...
- Not OK: "PrYv"


## Events

- **Don't use "event"**; it must remain a technical word used when describing Pryv's inner workings (e.g. in developer documentation)
- To describe events of a certain type, use the word for that type: **notes, pictures, positions, numerical values, etc.**
- To describe events of mixed or undetermined type, use **"content"** for uncountable cases and **"item(s)"** for countable cases


## Miscellaneous

- Putting content in the trash is **"deleting"**, not "trashing"
