# Pryv guidelines

Pryv is made of many heterogeneous components, written by different people, and we just can't do without at least a minimal set of guidelines. As for any of those, our goal is to minimize friction in collaboration and delivery/takeover by requiring a reasonable level of uniformity and consistency.


## Audience

Everyone working on Pryv apps and services, either internally or on mandate from us.


## Contents

We try to be brief and terse, keeping to guidelines themselves and avoiding the rationales behind.

- **Coding** guidelines are in `code`
	- [General](https://github.com/pryv/guidelines/blob/master/code/general.md)
	- [Javascript](https://github.com/pryv/guidelines/blob/master/code/javascript.md), with .jshintrc files for [Node.js](https://github.com/pryv/guidelines/blob/master/code/javascript-node.jshintrc) and [browser](https://github.com/pryv/guidelines/blob/master/code/javascript-browser.jshintrc) code
- **Collaboration** guidelines are in `collaboration`
	- [Development cycle](https://github.com/pryv/guidelines/blob/master/collaboration/development-cycle.md)
	- [Definitions of "ready"](https://github.com/pryv/guidelines/blob/master/collaboration/definitions-of-ready.md)
	- [Definitions of "done"](https://github.com/pryv/guidelines/blob/master/collaboration/definitions-of-done.md)


## Usage

Read and understand (or clarify) the guidelines that pertain to your work for Pryv. Note that specific guidelines (e.g. for a particular language) always apply over general guidelines in case of contradiction. If anything rubs you the wrong way, discuss it. Everything is a work-in-progress, everything is debatable, but nothing should be silently ignored. So let's talk if you...

- just disagree
- feel your specific case calls for doing things differently
- think of aspects that should be covered here but aren't, or that are covered here but shouldn't.
