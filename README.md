# PrYv guidelines

PrYv is made of many heterogeneous components, written by different people, and we just can't do without at least a minimal set of guidelines. As for any of those, our goal is to minimize friction in collaboration and delivery/takeover by requiring a reasonable level of uniformity and consistency.


## Audience

Everyone working on PrYv apps and services, either internally or on mandate from us.


## Contents

We try to be brief and terse, keeping to guidelines themselves and avoiding the rationales behind.

For now we just have coding guidelines (in `code`), for general aspects and Javascript. The goal is to add coding guidelines for every other language that we frequently use (starting with HTML/CSS), as well as UI and—if applicable—UX guidelines (in a future `ui-ux` folder).


## Usage

Read and understand (or clarify) the guidelines that pertain to your work for PrYv. Note that specific guidelines (e.g. for a particular language) always apply over general guidelines in case of contradiction. If anything rubs you the wrong way, discuss with us. Everything is a work-in-progress, everything is debatable, but nothing should be silently ignored. So let's talk if you...

- just disagree
- feel your specific case calls for doing things differently
- think of aspects that should be covered here but aren't, or that are covered here but shouldn't.
