# Collaboration guidelines

## Definition of done

Unless extended or redefined in a particular project, a developed task/feature is considered "done" when the following conditions are met:

1. Automated tests cover the added functionality
2. All tests pass
3. Documentation is up-to-date
4. Version number is up-to-date
5. Change log (if applicable) is up-to-date
6. Data migration (if applicable) is up-to-date and covered by tests
7. Repositories (code, documentation...) are committed and pushed to GitHub
8. Build succeeds on continuous integration server
9. Code has been peer-reviewed if relevant
10. New functionality has been validated by users representative


## Development cycle

A quick reference for our internal team.

### Each release

1. Plan release: pick features/tasks (or higher level themes), estimate (effort points, no days/hours); output: release contents
2. Iterate till complete, reviewing progress & adjusting course as needed
3. If relevant: demo + review release with larger audience (other stakeholders)
4. If relevant: release retrospective meeting


### Each iteration

1. Planning meeting: pick features / tasks, estimate (hours), taking into account release planning; output: iteration contents
2. Implement; output: candidate product increment
3. Demo + review work done; output: validated product increment
4. If relevant: iteration retrospective meeting


### Each working day

Quick standup meeting, where each of us tells 1) what she's been doing for the project since the last standup meeting she attended, 2) what she plans to do until the next one, and 3) whether she's experiencing issues or impediments to her work.
