# Meetings

Quick reminders covering a few specific pain points; by no means comprehensive.

## Iteration review & planning

- **Prepare** what you're going to say (and how, e.g. demo) for each of your projects beforehand, notifying the team if you expect your presentation(s) to take longer than usual
- **Stand up** to speak to the other team members, who **keep their laptops and devices shut**
- **Contents**:
    1. **Remind others of what you committed to** at the last iteration start
    2. **Present what you did (and what you did not)**, using demos and explaining if relevant (e.g. unplanned work or issues encountered)
    3. **Present what's coming next** (overall priorities) for the next iteration(s)
- **Keep it short, factual and interesting**
    - Quick feedback from other members is fine, but any further discussion belongs in ad-hocs meetings
    - If it's not interesting to the whole team, either you should present differently or it belongs elsewhere
