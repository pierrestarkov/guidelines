# Pryv guidelines

Pryv is made of many heterogeneous components, written by different people, and we just can't do without at least a minimal set of guidelines. The goal is to minimize friction in collaboration and delivery/takeover by requiring a reasonable level of uniformity and consistency.


## Contents

- **Coding** guidelines
	- [General](code-general.html)
	- [Javascript](code-javascript), with .jshintrc files for [Node.js](code/javascript-node.jshintrc) and [browser](code/javascript-browser.jshintrc) code
- **User experience** guidelines
  - [Wording](ux-wording.html)
- **Collaboration** guidelines
	- [Development cycles](collaboration-development-cycles.html)
	- [Meetings](collaboration-meetings.html)
	- [Definitions of "ready"](collaboration-definitions-of-ready.html)
	- [Definitions of "done"](collaboration-definitions-of-done.html)

We try to be brief and terse, keeping to guidelines themselves and avoiding the rationales behind.


## Audience

Everyone working on Pryv apps and services, either internally or on mandate from us.


## Usage

Read and understand (or clarify) the guidelines that pertain to your work for Pryv. Note that specific guidelines (e.g. for a particular programming language) always apply over general guidelines in case of contradiction. If anything bothers you, discuss it. Everything is a work-in-progress, everything is debatable, but nothing should be silently ignored. So let's talk if you...

- just disagree
- feel your specific case calls for doing things differently
- think of aspects that should be covered here but aren't, or that are covered here but shouldn't.
